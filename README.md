## Overview

## `Tasuku`

Means task in the Japanese language, We admire the japanese culture because of the efficiency and professionalism that they tend to have.
The reason behind creating this project is to solve the current need for an easy to use software which enables the user to focus more on the tasks in hand other than the software configuration and setup.
We believe Tasuku will be a breakthrough task manager, since itâ€™s easy to use and can get the job done easily with minimum effort.
